# Overview

CyberApps are web apps that support CyberAccount. CyberApps are loaded via [**iframe**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) on the CyberAccount website([wallet.cyber.co](https://wallet.cyber.co)). Before supporting CyberAccount, a CyberApp should be able to work with MetaMask smoothly. With CyberApp SDK, developers can eaily integrate CyberAccount by modifying two parts detailed below.

## Establish connection

Before everything, a CyberApp needs to establish a connection with the CyberAccount webpage. To initiate the connection request, simply call `cyberApp.start()`. If the app and CyberAccount are successfully connected, the method will return current user's CyberAccount detail.

## Send transaction

Transactions sent from CyberApps will be delegated to CyberAccount for user to sign. CyberAccount will display a confirmation modal to the user, showing the transaction details. Once the user has reviewed and signed the transaction, CyberAccount will send the transaction and provide the transaction hash back to the app.
