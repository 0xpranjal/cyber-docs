**Voting Process**

All governance proposals go through a two-week cycle.

Week 1

The proposer submits a new discussion thread in the appropriate category. By the end of the week, 1 of the top 30 delegates must give explicit approval on the discussion thread and move the proposal to a vote.

Week 2

All CYBER stakers, CYBER holders, and delegates are invited to vote on proposals. A snapshot to determine voting power for stakers, holders, and delegates

The proposal is approved if it satisfies the following minimum vote thresholds:

1. Quorum: The minimum number of total votes required to be cast. A quorum is measured as *a % of the non-excluded votes.* CYBER holders can exclude their vote by delegating to a special address. The primary use case is the CYBER community treasury.
2. Approval Threshold: The minimum number of votes to be cast in favor of approving a proposal. The approval threshold for each proposal is measured *as % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of yes/no votes cast in connection with a proposal.*
