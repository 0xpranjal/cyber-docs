With Native AA, users will gain access to a flexible authentication layer for their crypto accounts, eliminating the need to manage cumbersome seed phrases. Instead, they will enjoy a familiar Web2 UX, allowing for actions such as wallet purchases authenticated via a local device passkey, granting session key access to gaming accounts, or logging into social accounts using platforms like Gmail.
