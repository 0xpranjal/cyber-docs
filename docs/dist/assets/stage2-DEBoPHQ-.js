One of the primary objectives during this phase is to achieve data scaling by integrating Eigenlayerâ€™s EigenDA. EigenDA offers a cost structure that is sublinear to Ethereum gas prices, ensuring significantly reduced costs compared to the current L2 solutions that use Ethereum-based data availability (DA), even after the launch of EIP-4844. This integration sets the stage for developers to create high-performance and scalable social decentralized applications (dApps)."}),`
