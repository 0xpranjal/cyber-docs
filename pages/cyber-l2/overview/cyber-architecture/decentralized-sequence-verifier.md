### Decentralized Sequencer & Verifier

**Decentralized Sequencer**

Sequencers are fundamental components of a Layer 2 network. If the single sequencer becomes unavailable, transaction processing in the network is effectively disrupted. One could argue that the network still functions as users have the option to submit their Layer 2 transactions to Layer 1 directly. However, these transactions could take an extended period to finalize, leading to an inferior user experience. Furthermore, a prolonged delay may cause problems for time-sensitive transactions.

In a broader context, a centralized sequencer could have a negative impact, such as censoring user transactions, creating a single point of failure, and creating harmful MEVs. Cyber L2 employs cutting-edge technology and adopts a dual-stake model to build up a secure and lightning-fast decentralized sequencer network. The dual stake model utilizes both the CYBER token and EigenLayer’s restaked ETH to maximize network security. Users can participate by either spinning up a node or staking to the trusted AVS operators to share the network rewards (details in the Run a Node and Staking section).

**Decentralized Verifier**

Optimistic rollups maintain security on the condition that a minimum of one trustworthy entity verifies the accuracy of the state claimed by the rollup operators on Ethereum, ensuring it aligns with the proper execution of the state transition function on a series of transactions and the previously authenticated state. Cyber L2 builds up the decentralized verification network to detect and challenge the rollup’s state using the same dual-stake model. Users can participate by either spinning up a node or staking to the trusted node operator to share the network rewards (details in Run a Node and Staking section).
