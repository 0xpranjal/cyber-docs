## Establish connection

Before performing any operations, Cyber apps need to establish a connection with CyberWallet. To initiate the connection request, simply call `CyberApp.start()`. If the app and CyberWallet are successfully connected, the method will return `{connected: true}`.

## Send transaction

Transactions sent from Cyber apps will be delegated to CyberWallet for user to sign. CyberWallet will display a confirmation modal to the user, showing the transaction details. Once the user has reviewed and signed the transaction, CyberWallet will send the transaction and provide the transaction hash back to the Cyber apps.
