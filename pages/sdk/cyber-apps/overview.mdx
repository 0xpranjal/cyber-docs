## Establish connection

Before performing any operations, Cyber apps need to establish a connection with CyberAccount. To initiate the connection request, simply call `CyberApp.start()`. If the app and CyberAccount are successfully connected, the method will return `{connected: true}`.

## Send transaction

Transactions sent from Cyber apps will be delegated to CyberAccount for user to sign. CyberAccount will display a confirmation modal to the user, showing the transaction details. Once the user has reviewed and signed the transaction, CyberAccount will send the transaction and provide the transaction hash back to the Cyber apps.
