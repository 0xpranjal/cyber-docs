### Stage 4 (Q4 2024): Launch CyberDB

In the fourth phase, our primary objective is to complete the enshrined social graph protocol by introducing CyberDB. CyberDB is dedicated to providing an accessible, secure, scalable, and verifiable data network tailored for storing social data of lesser economic significance. It will function as the shared data infrastructure for the entire Cyber ecosystem and potentially other Superchain L2s. A fundamental aspect of CyberDB's design is its Ethereum account compatibility, fostering data interoperability and enhancing user experience. Moreover, CyberDB is constructed upon EigenLayerâ€™s AVS architecture, enabling Ethereum validators to join to provide redundancy and ensure data availability. A slashing mechanism will be implemented to safeguard operational integrity and optimize performance.
