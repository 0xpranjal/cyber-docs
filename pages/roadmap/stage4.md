### Stage 4 (Q1 2025): Upgrade to Native AA

In the fifth stage, our primary objective is to drive mass adoption within the Cyber ecosystem by introducing a groundbreaking user experience (UX) overhaul. Through the transition to Native Account Abstraction (AA), users will witness significant enhancements in their interactions with the Cyber L2.

**Seedless experience**

With Native AA, users will gain access to a flexible authentication layer for their crypto accounts, eliminating the need to manage cumbersome seed phrases. Instead, they will enjoy a familiar Web2 UX, allowing for actions such as wallet purchases authenticated via a local device passkey, granting session key access to gaming accounts, or logging into social accounts using platforms like Gmail.

**Gas delegation marketplace**

Maintaining backward compatibility with ERC-4337 is paramount during the transition to the Native AA architecture. The existing ERC-4337 infrastructures, including various paymaster strategies and the gas fee delegation marketplace, can seamlessly integrate into the Cyber L2. This integration ensures users can benefit from a gasless experience within the Cyber ecosystem, ultimately reducing barriers to entry and enhancing overall user engagement.
