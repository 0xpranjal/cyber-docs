### **Governance**

CYBER stakers and CYBER holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on governance proposals. CYBER holders can either vote directly or delegate their voting power to an eligible third party. CYBER stakers can vote directly using CYBER staked. However, this should not be the case indefinitely. When decentralized node operators (previously mentioned AVS operators) go online, they should vote using all the CYBER staked to them respectively.

Specialized councils are formed with high-context delegates to streamline processes and make high-context judgments. The first council created is the Grants Council. A well-constructed grants program is a great way to accelerate the ecosystem's growth and attract high-quality builders. This program will establish a Grants Council of 4 members with a [CharmVerse](https://charmverse.io/) program manager. All grant proposals will follow a separate process different than described below.
