# CyberAccount Overview

## What is CyberAccount?

CyberAccount is a cross-chain smart contract wallet based on EVM that holds the user's social graph. It utilizes the ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) technical standard to enable multiple advanced features, including:

- **Sponsored Gas Costs**: It provides the ability for users to pay for others' gas costs or delegate payment to a third party.
- **Account Recovery**: In case of key loss, account security can be distributed among trusted entities or devices.
- **Batched Transactions**: Account abstraction makes it possible for users to make multiple calls within a single user operation, significantly improving the UX of dapps.
- **Customizable Security Protocols**: Users can establish flexible security rules tailored to their needs.
- **Gas cross chains**: Users can deposit gas from other chains to pay for the gas cost of the current chain.
- etc.
